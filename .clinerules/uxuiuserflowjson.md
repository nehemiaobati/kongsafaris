   - What to hide or simplify
   - Progressive disclosure
   - Content hierarchy

9. Testing Plan
   - Devices to test on
   - Browsers to test
   - Key scenarios to test
   - Edge cases to consider

Run a length-expansion stress test for this UI.

Context:
- Product/feature: [name]
- Key screens/components: [list]
- Target expansion factor: [30% / 50% / 70%]
- Target locales: [list]

Inputs:
[Paste UI copy, screenshots/links, and component constraints]

Provide:

1. High-Risk Strings
   - Strings most likely to expand significantly
   - Strings with variables/placeholders that can expand unpredictably

2. Breakpoints & Failure Modes
   For each screen/component, identify:
   - Where truncation will occur
   - Where wrapping will create layout shifts
   - Where buttons/inputs/nav items will overflow
   - Where table columns/cards will break

3. Recommended Fixes
   - Copy alternatives (shorter phrasing, remove redundancy)
   - Layout fixes (wrap rules, flexible widths, max-widths, responsive stacking)
   - Component fixes (icon-only variants, adaptive labels, overflow menus)
   - When truncation is acceptable vs not (and tooltip/expand patterns)

4. Test Cases
   - A checklist of “strings to test” + “screens to verify”
   - Suggested pseudo-localized examples (optional)

Format as a screen-by-screen punch list with recommended fixes.
